# Learning Web5 ðŸš€

Web5 is actually a technology I love, I love the fact that it is a technology that offers privacy and decentralization without the use of blockchain, how awesome is that, though I'm still learning about it, but I really love how it operates and the stuff I can build with it, also when **blackgirlbytes** talked about it and created a burn book, it was just soo cool. I can't wait to learn and build awesome stuff.
